# Aula Frontend Architecture & Performance Improvements

This document outlines potential architectural improvements and performance optimizations for the Aula Frontend application.

## Architectural Issues

### 1. State Management Challenges

- **Current approach**: Simple React Context/useReducer for global state
- **Issues**:
  - No clear separation between UI and data state
  - Global state updates likely causing unnecessary re-renders
  - Mixing global and local state management
- **Recommendations**:
  - Consider adopting a more robust state management solution like Redux Toolkit or Zustand
  - Implement a normalized state structure for data entities
  - Separate UI state from data/entity state
  - Use more granular contexts to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 2. Data Fetching Anti-patterns

- **Current approach**: Synchronous fetch calls in useEffect hooks
- **Issues**:
  - No caching mechanism for API requests
  - Missing request cancellation on component unmount
  - Duplicate fetch logic across multiple components
  - No retry mechanisms for failed network requests
- **Recommendations**:
  - Implement React Query or SWR for data fetching and caching
  - Create centralized API hooks for common data needs
  - Add proper error handling for network failures
  - Implement optimistic updates for better UX

### 3. Component Structure

- **Current approach**: Deep nesting of component folders
- **Issues**:
  - Inconsistent component organization (some with index.tsx, some direct exports)
  - Tight coupling between services and components
  - Missing proper error boundaries at strategic levels
  - Duplicated rendering logic across components
- **Recommendations**:
  - Standardize component structure across the codebase
  - Implement a consistent pattern for component organization
  - Add error boundaries for critical application sections
  - Create more reusable UI components to reduce duplication

### 4. Authentication Handling

- **Current approach**: Direct JWT manipulation and client-side validation
- **Issues**:
  - JWT refresh handling causing full page reloads
  - Imperative navigation (window.location) in service layer
  - Mixed direct localStorage access throughout the codebase
- **Recommendations**:
  - Implement a more robust auth provider with refresh token rotation
  - Use HTTP-only cookies where possible for JWT storage
  - Create a dedicated auth service layer with proper abstractions
  - Handle token refresh without page reloads

## Performance Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Modern Data Fetching

- Adopt React Query or SWR for automatic caching, deduplication, and background refreshing
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern for improved perceived performance
- Add request batching for related data needs
- Implement proper data prefetching for common navigation paths

### 2. Rendering Optimizations

- Add React.memo for pure components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement useMemo/useCallback for expensive computations and event handlers
- Use virtualization (react-window or react-virtualized) for long lists of ideas or comments
- Monitor and optimize component re-render frequency

### 3. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

- Implement route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
- Lazy load heavy components like rich text editors or complex form fields
- Dynamic imports for features not needed on initial render
- Consider micro-frontend architecture for larger feature sets

### 4. Optimized Asset Handling

- Review and optimize image loading strategy
- Implement responsive images with srcset for different device sizes
- Consider using WebP format with fallbacks for better compression
- Implement proper loading states during asset loading

### 5. Reduce JavaScript Execution

- Debounce/throttle frequently fired events (scroll, resize)
- Move complex calculations out of render paths
- Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement requestAnimationFrame for animations and non-critical updates

### 6. Mobile Performance Enhancements

- Optimize Capacitor integrations for better native performance
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders on low-powered mobile devices
- Implement adaptive loading based on device capabilities
- Consider implementing server-side rendering for critical paths

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Set up performance monitoring (Lighthouse CI, Web Vitals tracking)
   - Identify highest-impact performance issues
   - Create a performance budget

2. **Quick Wins**
   - Implement code splitting for routes
   - Add memoization for pure components
   - Optimize largest contentful paint elements

3. **Architectural Refactors**
   - Gradually migrate to improved data fetching patterns
   - Refactor state management incrementally
   - Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Establish performance testing in CI pipeline
   - Document performance patterns for new development
   - Regular audits of bundle size and rendering performance
